<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am a first-year Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence Engineering student at [CMU Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/index.html). I'm also affiliated with [CMU Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) and a member of [Robots Perceiving and Doing Lab](https://r-pad.github.io/), advised by Associate Professor [David Held](https://davheld.github.io/). 

Previously, I obtained Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) with [the Highest Honor](https://cee.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/undergraduate-honors-programs#:~:text=Highest%20Honors%20may%20be%20awarded,academic%20and%2For%20professional%20nature.). In the meantime, I also joined [Human-Centered Autonomy Lab](https://thehcalab.web.illinois.edu/) as a research assistant, advised by [Pulkit Katdare](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/grad-students/katdare2) and Assistant Professor [Katie Driggs-Campbell](https://krdc.web.illinois.edu/). I also joined [the Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html)  and [Ren Lab](https://www.labren.org/mm/) as a visiting scholar, advised by [Huxin Gao](https://ghx-0228.github.io/) and Professor [Hongliang Ren](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/people/academic-staff/professors/prof-ren-hongliang).

I am broadly interested in assistive robotics, which include but not limited to human-robot interactions, robot learning from demonstrations, etc. My ultimate goal is to develop algorithms that enable robots with fundamental skills (generalizable robot object manipulation, etc.) and learn from interactomh with humans in unstructured environments to assist with daily activities.

Besides research, I've also been self-learning piano since 2022. I'm an amateur pianist playing anime theme songs arrangements, and I'm a huge fan of [Animenz](https://www.animenzpiano.com/)! You can find my piano recital videos in my [![YouTube](images/music/icons8-youtube-30.png)](https://www.youtube.com/@lyuxinghe630) or [![Bilibili](images/music/icons8-bilibili-30.png)](https://space.bilibili.com/1685669438)
